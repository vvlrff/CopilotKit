"""AG2 reasoning agent — surfaces the model's reasoning as AG-UI events.

Backs two showcase cells (both share this one backend):
    - reasoning-custom   (custom amber ReasoningBlock slot)
    - reasoning-default  (CopilotKit's built-in reasoning card)

Mirrors `showcase/integrations/agno/src/agents/reasoning_agent.py`, adapted to
AG2 1.x. The agent is a plain `Agent`: when the model returns reasoning, AG2's
`AGUIStream` maps it to REASONING_MESSAGE_* events (role "reasoning") ahead of
the TEXT_MESSAGE_* answer — no custom route needed.

With the OpenAI Responses config a reasoning item reaches the stream through
its summary text, so the reasoning card shows whatever summary the provider
returns (the aimock fixtures' `reasoning` field is delivered that way).

The global httpx hook installed in agent_server.py forwards the inbound
`x-aimock-context` header onto the outbound OpenAI call so aimock matches the
ag2-scoped fixture.
