"""AG2 agent backing the Multimodal Attachments demo.

Vision-capable AG2 ``Agent`` (gpt-5-mini) that accepts image + PDF
attachments. The frontend (src/app/demos/multimodal/page.tsx) sends
attachments as AG-UI message content parts, and AG2 1.x's ``AGUIStream`` maps
image and document parts to typed model inputs natively.

The frontend's legacy-converter shim
(``src/app/demos/multimodal/legacy-converter-shim.tsx``) also APPENDS a legacy
``{"type": "binary", ...}`` mirror next to each modern part for LangChain-based
integrations. AG2's run-input parser strips parts it does not recognise (with a
warning) rather than refusing the run, and the modern part the mirror
duplicates is all this agent needs — so no request rewriting is required.
